                <p>The creature tells you that it is a type of faerie called a redcap. It says that they can’t be seen by humans unless they want to be seen. He continues to say that he can tell you how to find a cure for your sisters disease if you give it what it wants. Blood. To paint his hat, of course, he explains. Normally he would have just killed you for it but was feeling generous today</p>

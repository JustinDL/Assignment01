                <p>You hear a high pitched voice behind you… “I know how you can save her…”.<br /> You jump at the noise, you hadn’t noticed someone coming up on you. Turning around there is no one in sight.<br /> “down here” the voice squeaks again. Upon looking down you see a tiny inhuman looking figure with a red hat.</p>

                <p>The creature tells you that it is a type of faerie called a redcap. It says that they can’t be seen by humans unless they want to be seen. He continues to say that he can tell you how to find a cure for your sisters disease if you give it what it wants. Blood. To paint his hat, of course, he explains. Normally he would have just killed you for it but was feeling generous today</p>
                <p><a href="#6">Agree </a>whats a little bit of blood for such a reward?</p>

                <p>The redcap quickly bites your hand near the base of your thumb, and collects the blood it wanted.  He takes out a pair of glasses telling you that they will let you see the world hidden to you. Putting them on you see large amounts of new creatures appear before you. The redcap then tells you an address and makes a swift exit. The location isn’t far, just  a park nearby. You head there immediately.</p>
                <p><a href="#8">Run </a>there's no time to lose!</p>
                <p><a href="#9">Walk </a>there are many strange creatures around and now that you see them, it’s best to be careful</p>

                <p>Declining such a generous offer was foolish, the redcap decides to take what it wants after you so rudely reject his kindness.</p>

                <p>Running  to the park you take good care to avoid the faerie all around you, but all of a sudden a female faerie pops up infront of you and the two of you collide. Being polite, you say “I’m sorry” and the very humanlike faerie before you smiles. now you owe her something, and until you pay it back, you are her slave.</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>You make it to the park. You had been here many times before but there is so much life here now that you can see what was hidden from you. Right in the middle, you see a hut. It was definitely not there before; you decide this must be where the redcap wanted you to go. You knock on the door and an old hag opens it, inviting you in. “You want to save your sister” it speaks, “are you willing to pay the price?”. You question what the price is, and it tells you it wants one thing, secrets. Your deepest darkest secret, something it can, and will, sell later on.</p>
                <p><a href="#10">Decline</a> You don’t like the idea of giving away something so personal, you offer to give “anything” else</p>
                <p><a href="#11">Agree </a>You have no clue what you are going to tell her, and hope it will be enough.</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>You walk up to the hag and go to whisper in her ear. Still unsure about what exactly you will say. As you open your mouth you immediately start talking, and before you know it you have told her a secret you didn’t even know you had. Your heart is beating and you feel an emptiness in your chest… it makes you uneasy, but it is worth it. The hag gives you a vial of some strange liquid promising it is what your sister needs.</p>
                <p>You make your way home and convince your sister to take this medicine. She is cured. The doctors are amazed as this sickness has vanished from your sister without a trace, you both live a happy life from here on. <b>Congratulations!</b></p>

                <p>The creature tells you that it is a type of faerie called a redcap. It says that they can’t be seen by humans unless they want to be seen. He continues to say that he can tell you how to find a cure for your sisters disease if you give it what it wants. Blood. To paint his hat, of course, he explains. Normally he would have just killed you for it but was feeling generous today</p>

                <p>The redcap quickly bites your hand near the base of your thumb, and collects the blood it wanted.  He takes out a pair of glasses telling you that they will let you see the world hidden to you. Putting them on you see large amounts of new creatures appear before you. The redcap then tells you an address and makes a swift exit. The location isn’t far, just  a park nearby. You head there immediately.</p>
